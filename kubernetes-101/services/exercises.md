Now you have had the opportunity to see a few examples of exposing our port, let's try a few exercises to consolidate your learning.

For these exercises we have created our deployment in the `exercise.yaml`{{open}} file. This contains a deployment entitled `exercise`.

To create our deployment, run `kubectl apply -f exercise.yaml`{{execute}}.

Verify the deployment is running by running `kubectl get deployments exercise`{{execute}}.

**Exercise 1**:-
Expose the `exercise` using cluster IP.

You then should be able to test the deployment is exposed by running the following commands
`export EX_CLUSTER_IP=$(kubectl get services/exercise -o go-template='{{(index .spec.clusterIP)}}')
echo EX_CLUSTER_IP=$EX_CLUSTER_IP
curl $EX_CLUSTER_IP`{{execute}}

Verify that you see a response similar to the one below `<h1>This request was processed by host: exercise-768f8fdbc-fzqlr</h1> ` where the exact podname is replaced byt the pod name created in the deployment.

**Exercise 2**:-
Expose the `exercise`on port `8006` using target port and the name `exercisetarget`.

You then should be able to test the deployment is exposed by running the following commands
`export EX_TARGET_IP=$(kubectl get services/exercisetarget -o go-template='{{(index .spec.clusterIP)}}')
echo EX_TARGET_IP=$EX_TARGET_IP
curl $EX_TARGET_IP`{{execute}}

Verify that you see a response similar to the one below `<h1>This request was processed by host: exercise-768f8fdbc-fzqlr</h1> ` where the exact podname is replaced byt the pod name created in the deployment.

**Exercise 3**:-
Expose the `exercise`on port `8007` on the external-ip `[[HOST_IP]]` using the name `exerciseexternal` and external ip.

You then should be able to test the deployment is exposed by running the following commands
`export EX_EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get services/exerciseexternal -o go-template='{{(index .spec.clusterIP)}}')
echo EX_EXTERNAL_IP=$EX_EXTERNAL_IP
curl $EX_EXTERNAL_IP`{{execute}}

Verify that you see a response similar to the one below `<h1>This request was processed by host: exercise-768f8fdbc-fzqlr</h1> ` where the exact podname is replaced byt the pod name created in the deployment.

**Exercise 4**:-
Expose the `exercise`on port `8006` using the name `exercisenodeport` and nodeport.

You can then get the nodeport by running the following command.
`export NODEPORT=$(kubectl get -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services exercisenodeport)`{{execute}}

You then should be able to test the deployment is exposed by running the following commands
`export EX_NODEPORT_IP=$(kubectl get services/exercisenodeport -o go-template='{{(index .spec.clusterIP)}}')
echo NODEPORT=$NODEPORT
curl [[HOST_IP]]:$NODEPORT`{{execute}}

Verify that you see a response similar to the one below `<h1>This request was processed by host: exercise-768f8fdbc-fzqlr</h1> ` where the exact podname is replaced byt the pod name created in the deployment.
